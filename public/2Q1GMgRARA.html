            <h2>üè∏Important Gear When Playing Badminton</h2>
            <h3>1. Racket</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The type of racket used between players is made from different materials. A badminton racket can either be power-based, all-rounder, or speed-based. These three categories depend on the player‚Äôs strategy and gameplay.</p></li>
                    <li><p>When selecting a proper racket, it is recommended to purchase it physically instead of through online purchasing. You can‚Äôt properly test a racket online unless you have external resources. If you test a racket physically, you can decide whether the properties of that racket suit your style.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Another important factor to consider when choosing a racket is its weight. Rackets can range from lightweight to heavy, and the weight can affect your swing speed and control. A lighter racket may be easier to maneuver, while a heavier racket can provide more power behind your shots.</p></li>
                    <li><p>You can further improve your racket by adding proper strings and grip. Comfortability is a priority when playing badminton. You should be properly suited to your racket. The strings can boost your smashing power and improve your net games. The type of grip you choose can help you better control your racket.</p></li>

            <h3>2. Shuttlecock</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The shuttlecock, also called ‚Äòbirdie‚Äô is an important piece needed to play the game. Without a shuttlecock, there will not be any badminton games to begin with.</p></li>
                    <li><p>There are two main types of shuttlecocks, plastic or	feather. However, there are personal preferences or game standards when choosing between the two. Plastic shuttlecocks are more preferred for beginners, while feather shuttlecocks are recommended for intermediate-expert level players.</p></li>
